WIP: multi-tenant and multi-project

This is work in progress

1) Please install the Red Hat based Service Mesh Operators

2) Do NOT use the information found at istio.io but use only https://maistra.io/

3) From istio.io at least https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/[traffic management] is usable


9) still working on it


Have a look at the Routes created in:

 oc get routes -n control-tenant-bb

 oc get routes -n control-tenant-aa

In base/controlplane/smcp-istio-tenant-aa.yaml is 'ior_enabled: true'

In base/applications/ns1-istio-gateway.yaml are the cluster external fqdn defined

In base/controlplane/smcp-istio-tenant-bb.yaml is 'ior_enabled: false'

In base/applications/ns3-istio-gateway.yaml is a wildcard used for the host.

Then OpenShift will create a FQDN for you.
